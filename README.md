## Parser bot
 I had to create a parser-bot for one company that will notify about news from certain sites if there are keywords in the news. I solve this problem by using Python libraries:  
 for parsing ->  **requests**, **beautifulsoup4**  
 for save datas I use  __*PostgreSQL*__. For this I use ->  **asyncpg** library which can work with asynchronous queries  
 as software use telegram bot. I develop this bot by ->  **aiogram** library which give us chance to develop asynchronous bot
